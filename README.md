## Background
The project plan establish a prediction model based on an [open database](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) which contains  615 observations and 14 attributes of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients. Machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost are possible choices for model fitting. Here our group aims to build prediction web app based on those data which allow Hepatitis prediction for new variants of a patient. 


## How our data look like ?

***The Features***

**Category:** The target feature. values: '0=Blood Donor', '0s=suspect Blood Donor', '1=Hepatitis', '2=Fibrosis', '3=Cirrhosis'

**Age:** age of the patient in years

**Sex:** sex of the patient ('f'=female, 'm'=male)

**ALB:** amount of albumin in patient's blood

**ALP:** amount of alkaline phosphatase in patient's blood

**ALT:** amount of alanine transaminase in patient's blood

**AST:** amount of aspartate aminotransferase in patient's blood

**BIL:** amount of bilirubin in patient's blood

**CHE:** amount of cholinesterase in patient's blood

**CHOL:** amount of cholesterol in patient's blood

**CREA:** amount of creatine in patient's blood

**GGT:** amount of gamma-glutamyl transferase in patient's blood
